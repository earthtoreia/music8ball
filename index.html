    <div class="typewriter"> Hi, I'm REIA. I am a singer, producer, DJ, and soon-to-be web designer/developer! 
    <br>
    This is my sketch for my project: Music 8 Ball

Just like a Magic 8 Ball, you can ask it questions. 
<br>
<br>
But this one responds with random songs on youtube! (Cool right?)
</p>
<br>
<H2>
STEP 1:
</H2>
<P>Tell the 8 ball your burning questions in the form of tags</P>

<h2>
Step 2:
</h2>

<p>Shake the Music 8 Ball</p>

<img src="8ballbox.jpg"alt="8 Ball Graphic" width="300" height="300">

<p>( Hover to Shake)</p>
<p>This would be a "Click to Shake" in the final product.</p>

<br>
<br>

<h2>
Step 3:
</h2>
<p>The 8 Ball will flip over and reveal a song based on your request.</p>

<!--- Oh hello there, you came to inspect my code. I am honestly just having fun here, and will hopefully get better and move into a career in tech in the near future. For now, enjoy this text art of a cat petting a cat <3

<p>My goal with this project is to develop my skills in Web Development, since I have some knowledge in <br>
    HTML and CSS, but would like to take it further during my time in between work. With this grant, I will be <br>
    able to practice building interactive desktop art from scratch, fusing my skills in design, my love for music, <br>
    and my newfound love for coding/engineering.
    </p>
    
    <p>Thank you for checking this out, and for giving space to noobs like me! </p>
